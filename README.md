# Hello World Projects in Multiple Programming Languages

This repository contains a set of "Hello, World!" projects implemented in Python, Node.js, and Rust, .... The purpose of this repository is to provide a simple example of how to print "Hello, World!" or to print a list of articles names using different programming languages, we also used docker in order to run different program inside a container
The following exercices are included in this training:

`hello-react-ruby`
`hello-world-angular`
`hello-react-c`
`hello-react-go`
`hello-react-node`
`hello-react-python`
`hello-react-rust`
`hello-react-v`

Each directory contains a single file with the code to print "Hello, World!" in the respective language. In addition, instructions are provided on how to run each project in its corresponding directory.

We also included a shell script exercice in order to automate some processes:

1. `example.sh` a script extrace words written between two quotes.
2. `zipping.sh` compress a repo, remove file included in the .gitignore and send it by email.
3. `db-run.sh` a script shell to create a docker container that runs either mysql or postgres, and checks every 10 seconds if the container is down in order to re-run it.
4. `backup.sh` a script shell to create a backup of the database
5. `restore.sh` a script shell to restore the backup of the database

Feel free to explore and modify the code to get a better understanding of each programming language. Happy coding!
